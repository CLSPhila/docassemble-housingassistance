# Philly Tenant Assistance Screener

## Project Background
This screening tool enables renters to find sources of rental assistance for which they may be eligible by asking them a series of questions about their background. The final result of the screening tool is a downloadable / printable document listing the names, locations and documentation required by each matching source of rental assistance.

## Technical Background
This screening tool is built on [Docassemble](https://docassemble.org/docs.html), an open-source expert system for guided interviews and document assembly, based on Python, YAML, and Markdown. If you are unfamiliar with Docassemble, the [Hello World](https://docassemble.org/docs/helloworld.html) tutorial provides a good starting place.

## Local Development
The easiest way to locally develop the Philly Tenant Assistance Screener is by running Docassemble on Docker. More detailed instructions on getting Docassemble running are available on the [documentation site](https://docassemble.org/docs/docker.html).

### Initial Setup

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) on your development machine

2. Download the Docassemble Docker image

On OS X, this can be done in the Terminal as follows:
```
docker run -d -p 80:80 jhpyle/docassemble
```

*Note that it can take up to 20 minutes for the local Docassemble instance to become accessible in the browser*

3. Clone the Philly Tenant Assistance Screener [repository](https://github.com/CLSPhila/docassemble-housingassistance) to a local directory

4. Make your changes to the Philly Tenant Assistance Screener code

5. Zip the parent directory

On OS X, this can be done in the Terminal as follows:

```
zip -r -X docassemble-housingassistance.zip docassemble-housingassistance
```

6. Upload the Philly Tenant Assistance Screener ZIP to the Docassemble playground's [package manager](http://localhost/playgroundpackages)

7. Run the interview in the Docassemble [playground](http://localhost/?i=docassemble.playground1%3Ainterview.yml)

### Subsequent Development

**Once Docker and Docassemble have been installed and the repository cloned, only steps 4 - 7 are necessary for further development.**

You may consider regularly upgrading your system's Docassemble version by running the following in your terminal:

```
docker pull jhpyle/docassemble
```

## Updating Styling (CSS)

The Philly Tenant Assistance Screener is styled through two CSS files stored in the [static](https://github.com/CLSPhila/docassemble-housingassistance/tree/master/docassemble/housingassistance/data/static) folder:

**phillytenant_bootstrap.min.css** - This file is a minified version of the Bootstrap CSS framework, v3.3.7 generated by running the LESS variables stored in `phillytenant.less` through the CSS generator at https://www.bootstrap-live-customizer.com/. Any styling changes to underlying bootstrap classes should be made by updating the LESS variables in `phillytenant.less` and regenerating and saving the `phillytenant_bootstrap.min.css` file on the https://www.bootstrap-live-customizer.com/ site. Do not add any custom CSS classes to the `phillytenant_bootstrap.min.css` file - those should go in `phillytenant_custom.css`. Make sure to save any changes in LESS variables to `phillytenant.less` before committing styling changes.

**phillytenant_custom.css** - This file is intended to hold any CSS that cannot be addressed by modifying Bootstrap LESS variables.
